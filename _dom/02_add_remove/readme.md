# Adding and Removing from the DOM
## Activity

In the scaffold code, there's some mistakes that need to be fixed. Unfortunately we can't edit the HTML directly we need to manipulate the DOM using the `script.js` file that is being imported.

Add code to script.js to make the following corrections in the DOM:

There is an anchor with a link to MDN's page on DOM but the text say's `click here` when it should say `DOM Manipulation`

The last `li` element say's that we'll be learning about Event Listeners but that is the next lesson, so that needs to be removed from the page.

Our `form` has an input and a submit but it doesn't have a label, put a label that says `Name:` before the input box

There's a `paragraph` with the ultimate question, but it is missing the answer. Append another `paragraph` to the parent div with the correct answer, which is `42`.
