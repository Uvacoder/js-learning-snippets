##### Personal Note

Learning JavaScript <u>after</u> learning *Ruby* has been challenging. Ruby is a lot neater and more organised as a language. I disliked JavaScript initially, but slowly it has grown on me, although I am still trying to figure things out and understand what's going on. Looking forward to growing my code learning in JavaScript.
